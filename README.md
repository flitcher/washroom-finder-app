## Washroom finder

Data from [Vancouver's public data](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/pages/home/).

The idea behind this project is to create a scalable application that can take in  washroom location from any source of data that is in json format. Therefore, if the City of Richmond, Burnaby, and/or surrey releases such information, we can simply put that into our application to scale with the cities that offer open data. 

Our technology stack used throughout the project is Java + Android. Coupled with a json parsing library and the Google Maps API, we are able to create our project from scratch. If we were given more time, our projects could be expanded to take in other forms of data such as water fountains.
