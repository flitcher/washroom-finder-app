## Washroom finder

Data from [Vancouver's public data](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/pages/home/).

The idea behind this project is to create a scalable application that can take in  washroom location from any source of data that is in json format. Therefore, if the City of Richmond, Burnaby, and/or surrey releases such information, we can simply put that into our application to scale with the cities that offer open data.
